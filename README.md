# Petduino Examples

This repository holds example code for the Petduino, which Datto is using for its 2016 "Kids Day", an all day workshop for the next generation of Dattoers to join us at the office and learn about electronics and software development. Each child will spend some time building and programming their Petduino and then take it home.
